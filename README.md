## OlÃ¡, Hello, Ã‡a va? ðŸ‘‹


Call me Matts or cl4pper.

I love to develop my ideas into code and help everyone else to develop their own ideas as well.

Using âœ¨React and âœ¨Node, and working as a âœ¨team, I believe we can fulfill our âœ¨goals.

### Main projects:

[React boilerplate](https://github.com/cl4pper/react-boilerplate): a react base project ready to help you start your idea development.

[Node API boilerplate](https://github.com/cl4pper/api-boilerplate): a Node base project ready to help you start your own API (*under tests*).


### Info:

If you wanna help, follow these [commit rules](https://cl4pper.notion.site/Commits-pattern-8e888f04338a48bf8b8ba0a39b1767f8) on Notion before push some change.

### Thanks and see y'all later.
