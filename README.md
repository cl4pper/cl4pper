## OlÃ¡, Hello, Ã‡a va? ðŸ‘‹


Call me Matts or cl4pper.

I love to develop my ideas into code and help everyone else to develop their own ideas as well.

Using âœ¨React and âœ¨Node, and working as a âœ¨team, I believe we can fulfill our âœ¨goals.

### Main projects:

[react-setup](https://github.com/cl4pper/react-setup): a react boilerplate project. Ready to help you start to develop your own ideas.

[node-plate](https://github.com/cl4pper/node-plate): a Node project boilerplate to fasten up your API development.


### Info:

If you wanna help, follow these [commit rules](https://cl4pper.notion.site/Commits-pattern-8e888f04338a48bf8b8ba0a39b1767f8) on Notion before push some change.

### Thanks and see y'all later.
